# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Ron Zuidema

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 28, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0: Tuesday, July 28
Started looking for a project. I have some ideas but not quite clear yet on how to bring it all together to something really useful. I will sleep on it tonight.  

---
### R1D1: Wednesday, July 29
**Today's Progress:** Figured out the project. It's going to be a Python based Price Comparison Tool for products I regularly buy myself. It's going to be about something like 30 products tracking prices from 10 webshops. The main phases of the project are going to be:
1. Extract the data from the webshops concerning the products via Python Scrapy Framework.
2. Put the data in a SQL database.
3. Present the information through a webapplication made in Django, preferably with graps
4. Mail me the results daily. Maybe even some kind of alert for when a price drops significantly.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start a project for real now, it's been on my mind for some time now.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet. Projectlink on Github: https://github.com/databuzzer/100-days-of-code/

**UPDATE:** Got a little work done, build the first web scraper for the first website.  

---
### R1D2: Thursday, July 30
**Today's Progress:** Created the web scraping script for the 2nd store.

**Thoughts:** I got the data points scripted in a web scraper for two stores now. Now it's time to think about how to use this data and how to combine it. The end result should give me insights on what the prices per product are in any of the scraped stores. For storage I could use a database. Need to think what database and how to set it's structure up. Also need to learn how to work with GitHub for this project.

**Link to work:** Note to self: Put the scripts on GitHub.  

---
### R1D3: Friday, July 31
**Today's Progress:** Figured out how to use GitHub in Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC). Did some research on how to hide/protect password information from GitHub
repositories.

**Thoughts:** VSC implements GitHub very smoothly, hardly any extra work at all, which is great. For my project I want to store the data in a SQL database. I need to figure
out what kind of database (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, NoSQL?) and where and how I want to use it (my own webserver, cloud-based or local).

**Link to work:** Current project is a [Price Comparison Tool](https://github.com/databuzzer/price_comparison_tool) here on my GitHub.  

---
### R1D4: Saturday, August 01
**Today's Progress:** Researched possibilities to display the data online. Came to the conclusion that a Django web application hosted on AWS EC2 Free Tier would be the best option for now. 

**Thoughts:** I think getting to know Django and AWS is a good investment. These are two very popular and used tools in web developement. Other options I've researched are Dash and Flask to present the data online and my own webserver, Heroku or PythonAnywhere instead of AWS.

**Link to work:** Current project is a [Price Comparison Tool](https://github.com/databuzzer/price_comparison_tool) here on my GitHub.

### R1D5: Sunday, August 02
**Today's Progress:** Started with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours) at freeCodeCamp.orgto get a feel for JavaScript. Since I already know the basics of Python I pick up the beginning smoothly.

**Thoughts:** Since I was moving towards front-end with Python with Django I realized I might as well learn some JavaScript.

### R1D6: Monday, August 03
**Today's Progress:** Worked through the Basic JavaScript lessions 80 to 100. It's getting more complex now. :-)    

**Thoughts:** I notice that the basics are easy because I already know Python. Learning Python, as my first language, was way harder.

### R1D7: Tuesday, August 04
**Today's Progress:** Finished Basic JavaScript and ES6 from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours) at freeCodeCamp.org.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript is more satisfying than I initially thought it would be. Somehow I had a negative feeling towards it but that's completely gone now.

### R1D8: Wednesday, August 05
**Today's Progress:** Finished Regular Expressions from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours) at freeCodeCamp.org.

**Thoughts:** I kind of love and hate regex at the same time. It's so powerful and yet so tricky to get right some times! ;-)

### R1D9: Thursday, August 06
**Today's Progress:** Switched gears to developing a WordPress website according to the Udemy course [Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/).

**Thoughts:** Since WordPress is the foremost used CMS on the web it's useful to learn it.
