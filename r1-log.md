## Log

### R1D1: Tuesday, July 28
Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com
Started looking for a project. I have some ideas but not quite clear yet on how to bring it all together to something really useful. I will sleep on it tonight.

### R1D2: Wednesday, July 29
Thought of a nice personal project which combines all kind of useful skills for me to learn.
The project is price comparison tool. More details later.
