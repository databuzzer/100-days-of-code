The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 28, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0: Tuesday, July 28
Started looking for a project. I have some ideas but not quite clear yet on how to bring it all together to something really useful. I will sleep on it tonight.  

### R1D1: Wednesday, July 29
**Today's Progress:** Figured out the project. It's going to be a Python based Price Comparison Tool for products I regularly buy myself. It's going to be about something like 30 products tracking prices from 10 webshops. The main phases of the project are going to be:
1. Extract the data from the webshops concerning the products via Python Scrapy Framework.
2. Put the data in a SQL database.
3. Present the information through a webapplication made in Django, preferably with graps
4. Mail me the results daily. Maybe even some kind of alert for when a price drops significantly.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start a project for real now, it's been on my mind for some time now.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet. Projectlink on Github: https://github.com/databuzzer/100-days-of-code/

**UPDATE:** Got a little work done, build the first web scraper for the first website.  

### R1D2: Thursday, July 30
**Today's Progress:** Created the web scraping script for the 2nd store.

**Thoughts:** I got the data points scripted in a web scraper for two stores now. Now it's time to think about how to use this data and how to combine it. The end result should give me insights on what the prices per product are in any of the scraped stores. For storage I could use a database. Need to think what database and how to set it's structure up. Also need to learn how to work with GitHub for this project.

**Link to work:** Note to self: Put the scripts on GitHub.  

### R1D3: Friday, July 31
**Today's Progress:** Figured out how to use GitHub in Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC). Did some research on how to hide/protect password information from GitHub
repositories.

**Thoughts:** VSC implements GitHub very smoothly, hardly any extra work at all, which is great. For my project I want to store the data in a SQL database. I need to figure
out what kind of database (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, NoSQL?) and where and how I want to use it (my own webserver, cloud-based or local).

**Link to work:** Current project is a [Price Comparison Tool](https://github.com/databuzzer/price_comparison_tool) here on my GitHub.
