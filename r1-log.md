The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 28, Tuesday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0: Tuesday, July 28
Started looking for a project. I have some ideas but not quite clear yet on how to bring it all together to something really useful. I will sleep on it tonight.

### R1D1: Wednesday, July 29
**Today's Progress:**
Figured out the project. It's going to be a Python based Price Comparison Tool for products I regularly buy myself. It's going to be about something like 30 products tracking prices from 10 webshops. The main phases of the project are going to be:
1. Extract the data from the webshops concerning the products via Python Scrapy Framework.
2. Put the data in a SQL database.
3. Present the information through a webapplication made in Django, preferably with graps
4. Mail me the results daily. Maybe even some kind of alert for when a price drops significantly.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to start a project for real now, it's been on my mind for some time now.
**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet. Projectlink on Github: https://github.com/databuzzer/100-days-of-code/
